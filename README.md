# Overview
Two flavors of interpreter for the language Lox, as described in Robert Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book on compilers. This repo is laid out similarly to the book: 
work for the Java-based `jlox` interpreter based in Java and the C-based `clox` compiler live in their respective directories.
