# Overview
Two flavors of interpreter for the language Lox, as described in Robert Nystrom's
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book on compilers. This repo is laid out similarly to the book: 
work for the Java-based `jlox` interpreter based in Java and the C-based `clox` compiler live in their respective directories.

## Jlox
```
jlox/
├── AstPrinter.java
├── Expr.java   <!>
├── Lox.java
├── Scanner.java
├── Token.java
└── TokenType.java
```
There are three main components to the Jlox environment. The files `TokenType.java` and
`Expr.java` contain the syntactic foundations of the language; they contain the class definitions of Lox's lexeme primitives. Note that 
`Expr.java` is a file automatically generated by `tool/GenerateAst.java` to save me the effort of manually adding new elements to the grammar.

Next, `Scanner.java` is responsible for processing plaintext input and emitting tokens. These tokens are consumed by `Parser.java` and turned into grammar expressions.

Finally, `AstPrinter.java` and `Lox.java` are utility classes to help debug and interact with the language. The former supports pretty-printing 
syntax trees into a nested expression, and the latter runs a repl environmen.

## Clox
